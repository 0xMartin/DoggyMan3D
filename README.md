# Game

Main character is controlled from a third-person perspective. The player starts with a full number of lives, and if he runs out of lives, his journey ends, requiring a restart of the current level.

Player have the freedom to traverse the game world by walking or running, but with every dash, his stamina diminishes. When stamina runs out, player is unable to sprint until it replenishes, forcing them to wait for a brief moment. Additionally, low stamina levels decrease the effectiveness of attacks, making strategic management of this vital resource essential.

All pertinent information, including health, stamina, and inventory status, is readily displayed in the game's user interface (UI).

Within the game, player have the opportunity to collect various items strewn across the landscape. These items can prove invaluable on their journey and can be stored in an inventory with a capacity limit of four slots. Once the inventory is full, players must decide which items to keep and which to leave/use, adding an element of strategy to their exploration.

# Gates

Players will encounter gates that obstruct passage to further sections of the level. These gates serve as barriers that must be overcome to progress.
There are two primary methods by which players can open these gates:

* __Key Activation:__ Certain gates are secured by locks that can only be opened with the corresponding keys. Players must search the environment diligently to locate these keys, using them to unlock the gates and gain access to new areas.
* __Enemy Defeat:__ In some instances, gates may be guarded by formidable adversaries. By defeating these enemies in combat, players can remove the obstacle blocking their path and advance to the next part of the level.
