# Game

Player have the freedom to traverse the game world by walking or running, but with every dash, his stamina diminishes. When stamina runs out, player is unable to sprint until it replenishes, forcing them to wait for a brief moment. Additionally, low stamina levels decrease the effectiveness of attacks, making strategic management of this vital resource essential.

All pertinent information, including health, stamina, and inventory status, is readily displayed in the game's user interface (UI).

Within the game, player have the opportunity to collect various items strewn across the landscape. These items can prove invaluable on their journey and can be stored in an inventory with a capacity limit of four slots. Once the inventory is full, players must decide which items to keep and which to leave/use, adding an element of strategy to their exploration.
